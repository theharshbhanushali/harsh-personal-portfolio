        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there! I’m a passionate Computer Science student at the Parul Institute of Engineering and Technology, Parul University. My journey into programming began with a fascination for how computers work, and it has since evolved into a deep love for solving problems and building innovative solutions.</p>
        <p>I’m particularly interested in the exciting fields of machine learning and robotics, where I get to combine creativity with cutting-edge technology. I’m constantly learning, experimenting, and striving to push the boundaries of what’s possible.</p>
        <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me exploring new ideas, working on personal projects, or diving into the latest tech trends.</p>
        <p>Feel free to connect with me and explore my work!</p>
